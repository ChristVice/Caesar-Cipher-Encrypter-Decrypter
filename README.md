# Caesar Cipher Encrypter/Decrypter

In cryptography, Caesar cipher is one of the most known and simplest encryption methods. The method substitutes each letter in a plaintext with a letter of some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

This project contains two ways to encrypt/decrypt text using Caesar's Cipher: CaesarCipherGUI and CaesarCipher.

CaesarCipherGUI utilizes Tkinter to create a visual representation where the user can modify the alphabet and shift position. Additionally, it includes a text field to input the desired text to be encrypted or decrypted.

CaesarCipher is a simple program where the user can enter specific inputs for the alphabet and shift positions.
